## Abstract
In this project, we use methods of machine learning in order to predict the result of soccer matches. We test using many methods of classifiers to solve this problem. The aim is using data mining algorithms in combination with machine learning to predict results of soccer matches in English Premier League (EPL). The basic implementation is by gathering and processing of EPL data, analyzing soccer matches, classification using various algorithms.
